## About `src/theme`

This section will show how the customization of the layout is done in Docusaurus.

#### Why `.js`?
We use extension `*.js` inside folder `src/theme` here because this is automatically generated files supported by Docusaurus.

#### How to eject a part of the theme to custom:
- Go to this Docusaurus directory
- Run `pnpm run swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic`
- Select a part you want to eject and you will see new files `*.js` to customize.
