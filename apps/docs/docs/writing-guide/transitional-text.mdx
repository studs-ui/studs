# Transitional Text

**Purpose:** Reassure the user that an action is taking place.

Many of our applications have delays after users submit their work for quoting, make significant changes, or reload web-based applications. During these waiting periods, transitional text can be used to inform the user they aren’t waiting in vain.

If the transitional text appears after the user completes an action, use the progressive form of the verb described in the CTA.

Ex. Submit – Submitting, Calculate – Calculating, Save – Saving, and so on.

## Format and Punctuation

**Punctuation:** You can also use ellipses (…) to indicate the transitional delay will be brief.  For example: “Submitting design…”, “Calculating...”, and “Saving results…”
