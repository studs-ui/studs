# Alternative Text

**Purpose:** To describe images, icons, and other visual media to users who may be visually impaired or have other disabilities that make it challenging to interpret images.

## Guidelines

Be descriptive: Describe the image, graphic, or visual element, including the content, purpose, and context of the image. For example, if the image is a picture of a dog playing in a park, the alt text should describe the breed of the dog, what it is doing, and the surroundings.

**Keep it short:** Aim for no more than 125 characters.

**Avoid using "image of" or "picture of":** Describe the image's content directly. For example, instead of saying "image of a cat", say "a black and white cat sitting on a windowsill".

**Be specific:** Use specific and accurate terms to describe the image. For example, use "bicycle" instead of "vehicle" or "two-story house" instead of "large building".

**Consider the context:** When writing alt text, consider the context in which the image appears. For example, if the image is part of a chart or graph, the alt text should describe the information presented in the chart or graph.
