# Lists

**Purpose:** Help the user quickly and easily understand information.

Lists can be an effective way to present information in a structured and easy-to-read format. Consider the user's needs and preferences when deciding whether to use a list and how to structure it. Lists should be used sparingly and only when they enhance the user's experience.

**Consistency:** Ensure all list items are grammatically consistent with one another. For example, if the first list item is a complete sentence ending with a period, all other sentences in the list should also end with a period.

**Parallelism:** Each item in the list should follow the same sentence structure and pattern.

In this example, each item in the list begins with a verb ("buy," "get," "pick up"), making it easy to follow and understand.

- Buy milk
- Get eggs
- Pick up bread

Here is the same example without parallelism.

- Need milk
- Get eggs
- Bread

**Punctuation:** For unordered lists, use bullets. For ordered lists, use numbers or roman numerals to indicate the order of the items.

**Style:** Each list item should be a fragment or a complete sentence. Use sentence-style capitalization for items that are sentence fragments (i.e., the first word is capitalized, but there is no period at the end). Use sentence-style capitalization and punctuation for items that are complete sentences (i.e., the first word is capitalized, and there is a period at the end).

## Unordered list

Unordered lists are best suited for presenting items that are related but don't necessarily have a specific order, such as a list of features or benefits.

**Example of an unordered list:**

Tools for building design:

- Selection tool
- Line tool
- Arc tool
- Circle tool
- Rectangle tool
- Polygon tool
- Text tool
- Dimensioning tool
- Hatch tool
- Layer management tool

## Nested unordered list

A nested unordered list can be useful for presenting subcategories within a main category, such as a list of options within a settings menu. By using nested lists, it's possible to create a clear hierarchy of information that is easy for users to follow.

**Example of a nested unordered list:**

Settings:

- General settings
    - Language
    - Time zone
    - Notification preferences
- Security settings
    - Password
    - Two-factor authentication
    - Privacy settings
- Appearance settings
    - Theme
    - Font size
    - Background color
- Payment settings
    - Billing information
    - Subscription details
    - Payment methods

## Ordered list

Ordered lists are a great way to present information that has a specific order or sequence, such as a set of instructions or steps to complete a task.

**Example of an ordered list:**

Creating a floor plan:

1. Open a new document and set the page size.
2. Draw the outer walls of the building using the line tool.
3. Add doors and windows using the appropriate tools.
4. Draw the interior walls and partitions.
5. Add furniture, fixtures, and equipment.
6. Add text labels and dimensions to identify rooms and features.
7. Add annotations and notes as needed.
8. Organize the drawing into layers for easier management.
9. Save the drawing and export it to the desired file format.

## Nested ordered list

A nested ordered list can be used to present a hierarchical structure of information, where each item within the list has sub-items that need to be presented in a specific order.

**Example of a nested ordered list:**

1. Prepare the software.

1.1 Create a new document.

1.2 Set the units to feet and inches.

1.3 Choose the appropriate drawing scale, such as 1/4 inch to 1 foot.

1. Add necessary layers and views.

2.1 Create a layer for the floor plan.

2.2 Add views for the different levels of the building, such as a basement, first floor, and second floor.

2.3 Add a title block with the project name, date, and other necessary information.

1. Begin drawing the floor plan.

3.1 Draw the exterior walls of the building.

3.2 Add interior walls, doors, and windows.

3.3 Add fixtures such as plumbing and electrical outlets.

3.4 Add annotations such as room labels and dimensions.

1. Review and finalize the floor plan.

4.1 Review the floor plan for accuracy and completeness.

4.2 Make any necessary revisions.

4.3 Save the floor plan as a file for future use or distribution.
