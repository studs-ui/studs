# Errors

**Purpose:** Help the user achieve their goal. If necessary, inform the user there is a problem with how they try to achieve it.

To keep error messages brief and relevant, use verb-first instructions on how the user should proceed. We must jump straight to the essential information to keep it scannable and relevant. We should also avoid assigning blame or apologizing for the error.

**Don’t:**

- Assign blame
- Use technical jargon
- Write detailed messages
- Use “sorry”

**Do:**

- Offer a way forward
- Satisfy a sense of responsibility
- Maintain voice and tone
- Verb-first and concise instructions

Many users rely on our software to complete their work, meaning they have a greater sense of responsibility than the average consumer. To satisfy this sense of responsibility, the quality of information provided in error messages should clarify that there’s nothing else they should or could be doing to proceed.

## Types of errors

### Inline

An inline error message is displayed within the context of the user's input, next to the input field that caused the error. For example, if a user enters an invalid email address in a form, an inline error message may appear next to the email field to alert the user to the error. Inline error messages are often displayed in red text to draw the user's attention to the error.

**Example:** “Enter a valid email address”

### Detour

A detour error message is displayed in a pop-up or modal window that blocks the user from proceeding until the error is corrected. For example, if a user tries access a project list without logging in, they may be presented with a modal to enter their account details.

**Example:** “Log in to continue”

### Blocking

A blocking error message is displayed on a separate page or screen that the user is redirected to after encountering an error. For example, if a user tries to access a webpage when it is unavailable or undergoing maintenance, they may be redirected to a 404 page.

**Example:** "Oops, the page you were looking for could not be found. It may have been moved or deleted. Please use the navigation bar above or search bar below to find what you're looking for."
