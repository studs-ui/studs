# Empty States

**Purpose:** To indicate the empty state is intentional and educate the user on how to proceed.

The content used to fill empty states will vary according to the application. To guide the user, we can include UX copy that follows a simple formula – “To do X, do Y.”

The UX copy is clear, direct, and relevant, following the voice outlined in the Marketing Brand Guide. Note that descriptions, titles, and buttons can also direct users through empty states when necessary.

## Format and Punctuation

Empty states can contain a combination of titles, buttons, and descriptions. Follow the linked references for formatting and punctuation of each text pattern.
