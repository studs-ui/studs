# Descriptions

**Purpose:** Establish brand, set expectations, “nice to have” information, and reduce liability.

Being clear and concise is crucial for descriptions because they are often ignored, and a long description can also be intrusive to the surrounding design. Descriptions are great for communicating complex ideas and informing users of the implications of certain actions. If you decide that more detail might be needed, you provide information on where they can get that additional level of detail. 

When using descriptions to reduce liability, not just in the legal sense of the word, avoid using an asterisk (*) because they have a negative connotation of hidden details in the fine print. We should use descriptions to be upfront with our users and include essential information in a way that is easy to find, read, and understand.

Here is an example of how we can communicate a complex idea without introducing the user to a “wall of text”. The description remains concise and quickly informs the reader of the implications behind confirming a list. Even if the reader skips the description, the context provided by the title and buttons is enough to inform the user on how to proceed. Writing for scanning first and reading second is paramount when it comes to descriptions.

## Description Length

Try to keep descriptions fewer than 3 lines, an ideal length for most situations where they are necessary. If your description becomes longer than this recommendation, the user will be more likely to ignore the text or skim over the essential details.

## Format and Punctuation

**Capitalization:** Use sentence case for descriptive text, with only the first word and proper nouns capitalized.

**Punctuation:** Use appropriate punctuation to make the text clear and easy to understand. For example, use a period at the end of a complete sentence, a comma to separate items in a list, and a semicolon to separate independent clauses.

- **Lists:** Use commas to separate items in a list. For example: "The options are red, blue, and green."
- **Compound sentences:** Use a comma to separate two independent clauses in a compound sentence. For example: "The button is blue, and the text is white."
- **Introductory phrases:** Use a comma to separate introductory phrases from the main clause. For example: "With a single click, the user can submit the form."
- **Dates and addresses:** Use commas to separate elements in a date or address. For example: "The meeting is scheduled for Thursday, June 10, 2022, at 10 a.m."
- **Nonessential clauses:** Use commas to set off nonessential clauses in a sentence. For example: "The user, who is new to the app, may need assistance."
- **Separate adjectives:** Use commas to separate two adjectives. For example, "The user-friendly, intuitive interface makes it easy to use."
- **Pause/breaks:** Use commas to indicate a break or pause in the sentence. For example, "The app is designed for people who are looking for an easy way to manage their finances, not for professional accountants."
- **Numbers:** Spell out numbers one through nine in descriptive text and use numerals for numbers 10 and above.
