# Link Text

Using descriptive and meaningful link text is crucial for accessibility in UX writing. Users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies benefit from links that clearly describe their purpose or destination.

## General Guidelines

Descriptive Text: Avoid generic link text like "click here" or "read more." Instead, use link text that provides context and information about the link's purpose or destination.

**Do:** "Learn more about our privacy policy."

**Don’t:** "Click here for more information."

Concise: Keep link text brief but informative, making it easier for users to quickly understand the purpose of the link without overwhelming them with unnecessary details.

**Do:** "Download the user guide."

**Don’t:** "Click here to download the comprehensive 50-page user guide in PDF format."

Unambiguous: Ensure that the link text makes sense out of context, as screen reader users may navigate through a list of links without reading the surrounding content.

**Do:** "Register for the webinar."

**Don’t:** "Register now." (without surrounding context)

Distinguishable: Make links visually distinguishable from surrounding text through color, underlining, or other visual cues. This helps users with visual impairments quickly identify and navigate links.

**Do:** Underlined and colored link text

**Don’t:** Link text with the same style as the surrounding content
