# Numbers and Measurements

**Purpose:** Provide a clear and standardized way to read units and their numerical values.

NIST standards are widely used in scientific and technical communities, providing a consistent and reliable framework for communicating and interpreting numerical information. By following these standards, we can better communicate numerical values to our audience because they may be more accustomed to seeing this style versus the AP or Chicago styles outlined for marketing content.

## US Customary Units vs. SI Units

In the United States, both US Customary Units and SI Units are used in various contexts. Here are some guidelines to help you decide when to use one or the other:

### US Customary Units

**Standard Material Sizes:** When presenting dimensions and measurements for construction materials, such as lumber, drywall, or piping, use US Customary Units. These materials are commonly labeled and sold using inches, feet, and yards.

Example: "Cut the 2x4 lumber to 8 feet."

**Tools and Equipment:** When referencing numbers that involve the use of construction tools, such as tape measures, rulers, and framing squares, use US Customary Units.

Example: "Mark the plywood every 16 inches for stud placement."

**Industry-Specific Standards:** When referring to industry-specific standards and codes, use US Customary Units if these standards are based on this system of measurement.

Example: "Ensure a minimum clearance of 36 inches around electrical panels."

### SI Units

**Engineering Calculations and Scientific Data:** When dealing with engineering calculations, such as stress analysis or fluid dynamics, use SI Units. This system is widely recognized and preferred in scientific and engineering contexts.

Example: "The stress on the beam is 24.5 MPa."

## Decimals vs. Fractions

When presenting numerical values, it's essential to understand when to use decimals and when to use fractions. Choosing the appropriate format ensures that your content is clear, concise, and relevant to your audience's needs. Here are some guidelines to help you decide when to use decimals or fractions:

### Decimals

**Engineering Calculations and Scientific Data:** When dealing with engineering calculations, such as stress analysis or fluid dynamics, use decimals to express numerical values. Decimals provide a more precise and standardized format for these types of calculations.

Example: "The stress on the beam is 3.56 kPa."

**Currency and Financial Values:** When presenting financial information, such as costs or budgets, use decimals to express values in dollars and cents.

Example: "The total cost of the project is $12,345.67."

**Percentages and Ratios:** Use decimals to express percentages, ratios, and proportions in a clear and concise manner.

Example: "The mixture consists of 75.5% sand and 24.5% cement."

### Fractions

**Dimensions and Measurements:** When presenting dimensions and measurements related to length, height, or other construction-specific values, use fractions. Fractions align with industry standards and are more intuitive for construction professionals.

Example: "The stud needs to be cut to 7 1/4 inches."

**Standard Material Sizes:** When referring to standard material sizes, such as lumber, drywall, or piping, use fractions, as these materials are commonly labeled and sold using fractional measurements.

Example: "Use a 2x4 lumber piece for framing."

**Tools and Equipment:** When providing instructions that involve the use of construction tools, such as tape measures, rulers, and framing squares, use fractions, since these tools typically have markings in fractional units.

Example: "Mark the plywood at 3 3/8 inches from the edge."

## Guidelines

### 1. Decimal Format

Do not use (.) in front of abbreviated measurements.

**Do:** 2 in

**Don’t:** 2 in.

Include a 0 in front of the decimal separator when the value is less than 1.

**Do:** 0.2

**Don’t:** .2

### 2. Fraction Format

Always use simple, reduced fractions instead of complex or unreduced fractions.

**Do:**

- 7 1/4 inches
- 5/8 inch

**Don’t:**

- 7 2/8 inches (not reduced)
- 3/6 inch (not reduced)

Separate the whole number and the fraction with a single space, making it easier to identify and understand the different components.

**Do:**

- 8 1/2 feet
- 4 3/4 yards

**Don’t:**

- 8-1/2 feet (with a hyphen)
- 4.3/4 yards (with a period)

### 3. Spelling Out Numbers

Use a hyphen when you spell out numbers 21 through 99.

**Do:** Twenty-four

**Don’t:** Twenty four

### 4. Ranges

Use an en dash (–) without spaces to indicate a range of numbers.

**Do:** 25–75 (en dash)

**Don’t:**

- 25-75 (hyphen)
- 25—75 (em dash)

For a range of percentages, include the % on both numbers.

**Do:** 25%–75%

**Don’t:** 25–75%

For a range of measurements, only include the unit of measurement after the second number.

**Do:** 25–75 cm

**Don’t:** 25 cm–75 cm

### 5. Expressing Ranges in Text

Use "Between A and B" to refer to an inclusive range, encompassing all values from A up to and including B. “Between” ranges can be mathematically represented as A ≤ value ≤ B.

**Do:** "Enter a number between 1 and 10."

**Don't:** "Enter a number from 1 to 10."

"From A to B" emphasizes the starting point (A) and the endpoint (B) without necessarily including the endpoint. It is often used when the end of the range is not strictly included. “From” ranges can be mathematically represented as A ≤ value < B.

**Do:** "Customer Service is open from 9 AM to 5 PM."

**Don't:** "Customer Service is open between 9 AM and 5 PM."

### 6. Large Numbers

When writing large numbers greater than 999, use a comma for the thousands separator.

**Do:** 1,000,023

**Don’t:**

- 1 000 023
- 1.000.023

### 7. Consistency

Be consistent with your choice of units in a section.

**Do:**

- 1.5 kilograms
- 1 kilograms
- 3.2 kilograms
- 0.8 kilograms

**Don’t:**

- 1.5 kilograms
- 2 pounds, 3.27 ounces
- 3.2 kilograms
- 800 grams

Use a consistent level of precision.

**Do:**

- 12.34 kg
- 33.89 kg
- 100.12 kg

**Don’t:**

- 12.34467 kg
- 33.89 kg
- 100.123 kg

### 8. Symbols and Abbreviations

As a general rule, use symbols for inches and feet when space is limited, and use abbreviations when clarity is a priority.

**Do:** 5 ft 10 in

**Don’t:** 5’ 10”

### 9. Temperature

When using degrees Fahrenheit (°F) and degrees Celsius (°C), follow these guidelines:

1. Use the degree symbol (°) followed by the unit abbreviation (F or C) with no space between them.
2. Indicate negative temperatures with a minus sign (-) immediately before the number, without any space.
3. Use a period (.) as the decimal separator for decimal values.
4. Round temperatures to the nearest whole number or, in scientific contexts, to one decimal place.

**Do:**

- 75°F (24°C)

**Don’t:**

- 5 °F (24 °C) (Incorrect spacing)
- 75 F (24 C) (Missing degree symbol)
