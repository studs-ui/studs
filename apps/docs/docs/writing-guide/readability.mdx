# Readability

The Flesch Reading Score is a test that measures how easy or difficult a piece of writing is to read. The score is based on average sentence length and number of syllables per word. A higher score means easier reading, with a score of 60-70 being considered ideal.

While technical experts may have a high level of expertise in their respective fields, they can still benefit from a high level of readability. Our writing must ensure that all users, regardless of their abilities, can use our website or apps with ease. Maintaining a Flesch reading score of 60 is one way to ensure accessibility for all users, including those with cognitive disabilities or limited literacy skills.

## Guidelines

**Use short sentences:** Short sentences are easier to read and understand than longer sentences. Aim for an average sentence length of 15-20 words.

Long sentence: "The construction project timeline must take into account the availability of materials, the weather conditions, the project scope and budget, the skill level of the workforce, and any regulatory requirements or permits needed for the project."

Short sentence: "The construction project timeline considers materials availability, weather, scope, budget, workforce skill, and regulatory requirements."

**Use common words:** Using simple, everyday words that most readers will be familiar with can make your content easier to read and understand. Avoid using technical jargon or complex terminology that may be difficult to understand.

Complex word: "The project requires a comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation plan to address potential hazards and minimize exposure to liability."

Common word: "The project needs a thorough plan to assess and reduce risks and avoid legal issues."

**Use transition words:** Transition words and phrases can help guide readers from one idea to the next, making your content more cohesive and easier to follow.

Without transition words: "Pour the concrete into the mold. Tap the mold to remove air bubbles. Let the concrete dry for 24 hours."

With transition words: "To make a concrete block, start by pouring the concrete into the mold. Next, tap the mold to remove any air bubbles. Finally, let the concrete dry for 24 hours before removing it from the mold."

**Use active voice:** Active voice can make your writing more engaging and direct, and it can also help make it easier to understand who is doing what in your sentences. Here's an example:

Passive voice: "The project timeline was revised by the project manager."

Active voice: "The project manager revised the project timeline."

**Use headings and subheadings:** Headings and subheadings can help break up your content into smaller, more manageable sections, making it easier to scan and understand.

Without headings and subheadings: "Project Scope, Schedule, Budget, Safety Plan, Quality Control, Risk Management."

With headings and subheadings: "Project Scope: What is the project and what are its objectives?, Schedule: How long will the project take and what are the key milestones?, Budget: How much will the project cost and how will funds be allocated?, Safety Plan: What measures are in place to ensure the safety of workers and the public?, Quality Control: How will the quality of work be monitored and ensured?, Risk Management: What risks are associated with the project and how will they be managed?"

**Use visuals:** Visuals such as images, graphs, or charts can help illustrate your points and make your content more engaging and easier to understand.

**Avoid long paragraphs:** Breaking up your content into shorter paragraphs can make it easier to read and understand. Long blocks of text can be overwhelming and difficult to follow.

Without short paragraphs: "To create a 3D model, start by sketching the base shape of the model on the XY plane. Next, use the extrude tool to add depth to the model. Once the basic shape is created, you can add details and features to the model using various tools and commands."
