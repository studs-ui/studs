# Buttons, Links, and Actions

**Purpose:** Provide a way forward and allow the user to interact with the application.

**General guidelines:**
- Keep it 2-3 words or less
- Be specific
- Use the language of your target user

## Verb-First

Verb first phrases should be used when there is a specific action to the button. In this example, “Create New Project” does exactly that. Once the user clicks this button, a new project is created and they can begin working on their design.

### Guidelines

When there is one way forward, the verb-first button should be connected to the title. The title, “New Project”, is directly connected to the verb-first button, “Create New Project”. This leaves no ambiguity in what the user should expect after following through with a click.
- Connect to the title
- Be specific
- Start with a verb

## Nouns

Nouns should be used when the user is selecting between multiple options. As shown in this example, noun buttons are typically used in navigation and menus.

### Guidelines

Draw clear distinctions between nouns to avoid confusion about what each item means. Nouns should also fit the context of where and when they appear to improve clarity.
- Nouns should be distinct
- Should make sense as a “set” of options together
- Used when there are multiple options

## Links

Links are useful when providing background information, additional context, or alternative ways forward.

### Guidelines

When links are used with buttons, such as in the example provided above, they should be connected to the context of the verb-first button and title. Links have more flexibility in word choice because they can begin with either a noun or verb depending on the context. When choosing between verbs and nouns for links, prioritize clarity and consistency. 
- Be specific and avoid “Learn more” “Click here”
- Keep links further down the visual hierarchy when paired with buttons

## Format and Punctuation

**Capitalization:** Use title-case for buttons, links, and actions. "Submit Form", “View Account Details", “Forgot Password”.

**Abbreviations:** Use abbreviations only if they are widely recognized and commonly used. For example: "FAQ"

**Emphasis:** Use the specified color in your style guide to emphasize links and underline to further distinguish it from other text.
