# Confirmation Messages

**Purpose:** Reassure and inform the user of a process, avoiding operational costs from a lack of information.

Confirmation messages are crucial to maintaining the SST voice. Users should see us as clear, dependable, and trustworthy, and confirmation messages are vital to this reputation. We use confirmation to reassure the users of otherwise invisible processes like reviewing project notes or submitting a quote.

To create consistency from transition to confirmation, we should use the past tense verb of the CTA used to reach the confirmation.

This example does not inform users what they should expect after submitting a quote. Ambiguity does not cater to a good user experience, and it’s important to note that not setting expectations is not the same as not having expectations. If we don’t communicate them clearly to the user, they will set them for us, making it far more likely that they will be disappointed with the result.

Here, we use the past tense verb from the original CTA – Submit. We then use the descriptive text to set reasonable expectations for the user. This reduces operational costs when users would otherwise call or email customer service for more information. We should be empathetic to our users because they rely on our software to complete their work, which often leaves no room for ambiguity.

## Format and Punctuation

**Capitalization:** Use sentence case for confirmation text, with only the first word and proper nouns capitalized.

**Punctuation:** Use appropriate punctuation to make the text clear and easy to understand. For example, use a period at the end of a complete sentence, a comma to separate items in a list, and a semicolon to separate independent clauses.

- **Lists:** Use commas to separate items in a list. For example: "The options are red, blue, and green."
- **Compound sentences:** Use a comma to separate two independent clauses in a compound sentence. For example: "The button is blue, and the text is white."
- **Introductory phrases:** Use a comma to separate introductory phrases from the main clause. For example: "With a single click, the user can submit the form."
- **Dates and addresses:** Use commas to separate elements in a date or address. For example: "The meeting is scheduled for Thursday, June 10, 2022, at 10 a.m."
- **Non-essential clauses:** Use commas to set off non-essential clauses in a sentence. For example: "The user, who is new to the app, may need assistance."
- **Separate adjectives:** Use commas to separate two adjectives. For example, "The user-friendly, intuitive interface makes it easy to use."
- **Pause/breaks:** Use commas to indicate a break or pause in the sentence. For example, "The app is designed for people who are looking for an easy way to manage their finances, not for professional accountants."

**Numbers:** Spell out numbers one through nine in descriptive text and use numerals for numbers 10 and above.
