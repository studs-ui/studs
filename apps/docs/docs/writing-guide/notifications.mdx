# Notifications

**Purpose:** Remind the user or inform them of something time sensitive.

Notifications may consist of a title and description. For the title and description pattern, the title should include the essential information so that the user does not need to read the description. Descriptions should be used for “nice to have” information or anything that adds to the title’s urgency.

## Toast Notifications

**Purpose:** To convey low-priority or context-specific information without interrupting the user's flow.

Typically used to provide feedback or confirmations about user actions, such as saving a file or sending a message.

**Grammar and Punctuation:** Use sentence case and proper punctuation. Avoid using all-caps.

**Format:** Keep the length of the text short, ideally under 50 characters.

## Modal Notifications

**Purpose:** To convey important messages, such as security alerts, updates, or confirmation prompts.

Modal notifications are pop-up windows that appear in the center of the screen to inform the user about an event or action. When writing for modal notifications, communicate the value of your message so that it can be read at a glance.

**Grammar and Punctuation:** Titles - Descriptions - Buttons

**Format:** Title, description, and buttons.

## Banner Notifications

**Purpose:** To convey important information that requires the user's attention, such as system updates, alerts, and reminders.

Banner notifications are notifications that appear at the top or bottom of the screen and can include things like alerts, reminders, or updates. They are less intrusive than modal notifications, but still capture the user's attention.

**Grammar and Punctuation:** Provide actionable information that guides the user on what to do next. Avoid using technical jargon or complex sentences.

**Format:** Be concise, keeping it around 100 characters.
