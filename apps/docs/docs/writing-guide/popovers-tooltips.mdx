# Popovers and Tooltips

**Purpose:**

Popovers - ****To provide additional information, options, or settings that are not directly visible.

Tooltips - To provide brief descriptions or explanations of UI elements, indicate what will happen when a particular action is taken, and to clarify the meaning of UI elements.

## Popover

A popover is a small window that appears on top of the main UI when a user clicks on a button or icon. Popovers usually contain more detailed information, such as options or settings, and can sometimes have interactive elements such as buttons or forms. They can be used to display additional information, actions, or functionality that are not directly visible in the main UI.

## Tooltips

Tooltips are small, informative messages that appear when a user hovers over an icon, button, or text. They typically provide a brief description or explanation of the item being hovered over. Tooltips are useful for providing additional context and guidance to users and can be used to clarify the meaning of UI elements or to indicate what will happen when a particular action is taken.
