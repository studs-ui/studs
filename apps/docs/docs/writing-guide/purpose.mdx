# Purpose

This guide will define our standards for UX writing and can act as a starting point when you write your application-to-user conversation.

## Cohesion

Establishing standards in UX copy and making this information accessible will ensure a sense of cohesion across our many applications. Whether we acquire the application through outside agencies, develop them in-house, or across many teams, our users will hear the same voice guiding them through the experience.

## User Experience

UX writing provides an optimal user experience when our words go unnoticed. The user didn’t come here to read – they came to get work done. If we do our job right, they won’t remember the words we wrote because they would have been so natural, and blended into the design, that they go unnoticed.
